# React Native App

A simple mobile app built with React Native, incorporating two different APIs for weather and news information. While it may not be the most developed app, the intention was to explore React Native and integrate APIs.

## Table of Contents
1. [Home](#home)
2. [Weather](#weather)
3. [News](#news)

## Home

The home page serves both as a navigation hub and a screen that displays the date, current week, and current time.

---

## Weather

The weather screen provides information about the weather in a hardcoded location, Huddinge, Sweden. It includes details such as:

- Location
- Current temperature
- Description
- and more...

## News

The news screen utilizes the "New York Times" API to showcase various articles. Users can click on an article to get more information, leading to a separate screen with additional details, including a description and an image.
